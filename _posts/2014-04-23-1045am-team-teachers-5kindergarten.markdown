Two Sundays a month during the 10:45am service this team of adults and teens share the lesson presentation to student’s 5yr-Kindergarten.  Kids will be involved in worship, active play, object lessons, puppets, prayer, video and drama that will teach God’s Word and purpose for their lives. Time commitment ranges from 6 months to one year. Arrive 15 minutes before service time.
