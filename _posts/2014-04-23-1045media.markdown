Two Sundays a month during the 10:45am services these adult and teen tech support run media and sound for the Great Room and Upper Room worship services. They will operate sound for worship, sound effects, videos, and slideshows. Training is available. Time commitment ranges from 6 months to one year. Arrive 15 minutes before service time.
