  <h2>Sound Operator</h2>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Sound Ops serve two Sundays or Wednesdays a month. They are responsible for mixing and adjusting the sound levels during worship and message portions of the sermon. Sound Ops are also encouraged to attend the worship band rehearsal prior to their service. Prior experience is recommended but not required (will provide training if necessary). This is a one year commitment. </p>
