Simple static site for volunteer opportunities at CalvaryTriad (calvarytriad.com)

## Getting things setup

The site uses coffeescript, sass, and jekyll. This assumes you have the coffeescript and sass gem installed on your system

1. To run the site locally, use `jekyll serve --watch`

2. To compile CoffeeScript, `coffee --watch -c assets/js/app.coffee`

3. To compile SASS, `sass --watch assets/css/all.sass:assets/css/all.css`
